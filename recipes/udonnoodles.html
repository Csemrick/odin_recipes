        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These spicy garlic udon noodles are chewy and savory with a garlicky spicy sauce, and a winner for a quick weekday meal. If you want to jazz them up even more, serve topped with a fried egg or stir in some sautéed shrimp.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <p><strong>Sauce</strong></p>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, finely minced</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons hoisin sauce</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sesame oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or to taste</li>

            <p><strong>Noodles</strong></p>

            <li>2 (8 ounce) blocks frozen udon noodles (such as Sanuki®</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon sliced green onions</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon toasted sesame seeds</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the sauce by combining garlic, soy sauce, hoisin, sesame oil, and red pepper flakes in a small bowl; set aside.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and add udon blocks. Let them sit in the water until they start to unwind, 1 to 2 minutes. Noodles should remain a little chewy. Drain noodles, and return to the pot.</li>
            <li>Add sauce, and stir until noodles are well coated. Move to a serving dish, garnish with sliced green onions and sesame seeds, and serve.</li>
